		<p> Hi! My name is Jessica Miller, and I am still figuring it out. I'm perpetual student, and have had a few life-track changes so far, most catalyzed by the Boston Startup Institute (Summer '12 alum woot!) I have a degree in Painting 

			I hope in the long run to bring my skills in web development and design to ventures in philanthropy, non-profit works, and support for women's health. Through this program I want to launch )  </p>
