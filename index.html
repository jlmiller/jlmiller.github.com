				<p> Hi! My name is Jessica Miller. I've had a few life-track changes so far, most catalyzed by the Boston Startup Institute (Summer '12 alum woot!) I hope, in the long run, to bring my skills in web development and design to ventures in philanthropy, non-profit works, and support for women's health. 
					<br>
				My goals for this course are to learn how to create Wordpress themes, launch a simple prototype with Twitter Bootstrap, begin to understand the Ajax framework, and make cleaner, more responsive code all the while. Let's see how much I can learn in six weeks!</p>
