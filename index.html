		<p> Hi! My name is Jessica Miller, and I am still figuring it out. I'm perpetual student, and have had a few life-track changes so far, most catalyzed by the Boston Startup Institute (Summer '12 alum woot!) <!--Potential writing, not sure yet, need to edit--> 

			I hope in the long run to bring my skills in web development and design to ventures in philanthropy, non-profit works, and support for women's health. My goals for this course--or, soon with the skills I'll learn--are to learn how to create Wordpress themes, make clean code, launch a simple prototype with Twitter Bootstrap, and begin to understand the Ajax framework. Let's see how much I can learn in six weeks!
