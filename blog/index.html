		<h2>Jolt my wax bed</h2> 

			<p>Few quips galvanized the mock jury box. Quick brown dogs jump over the lazy fox. The jay, pig, fox, zebra, and my wolves quack! Blowzy red vixens fight for a quick jump. Joaquin Phoenix was gazed by MTV for luck. A wizard's job is to vex chumps quickly in fog. Watch Jeopardy!, Alex Trebek's fun TV quiz game. Woven silk pyjamas exchanged for blue quartz. Brawny gods just flocked up to quiz and vex him. Adjusting quiver and bow, Zompyc killed the fox. My faxed joke won a pager in the cable TV quiz show. Amazingly few discotheques provide jukeboxes. My girl wove six dozen plaid jackets before she quit. Six big devils from Japan quickly forgot how to waltz.-->

		<h2>Is this the real life?</h2> 

			<p>
				Is this just fantasy?
				Caught in a landslide
				No escape from reality
				Open your eyes
				Look up to the skies and see
				I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
				Because I'm easy come, easy go
				A little high, little low
				Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

				Mama, just killed a man
				Put a gun against his head
				Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
				Mama, life had just begun
				But now I've gone and thrown it all away
				Mama, ooo
				Didn't mean to make you cry
				If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
				Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

				Too late, my time has come
				Sends shivers down my spine
				Body's aching all the time
				Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
				Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
				Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)
				I don't want to die
				I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all....
				Carry on, carry on.

			</p>

		<h2>July 21, 1969</h2>
		<h2>1969: Man takes first steps on the Moon</h2>
		<p> American Neil Armstrong has become the first man to walk on the Moon.
		The astronaut stepped onto the Moon's surface, in the Sea of Tranquility, at 0256 GMT, nearly 20 minutes after first opening the hatch on the Eagle landing craft.

		Armstrong had earlier reported the lunar module's safe landing at 2017 GMT with the words: "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."

		As he put his left foot down first Armstrong declared: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

		He described the surface as being like powdered charcoal and the landing craft left a crater about a foot deep.</p>

		<h3>'We came in peace'</h3>

		<p>The historic moments were captured on television cameras installed on the Eagle and turned on by Armstrong.

		Armstrong spent his first few minutes on the Moon taking photographs and soil samples in case the mission had to be aborted suddenly.

		He was joined by colleague Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin at 0315 GMT and the two collected data and performed various exercises - including jumping across the landscape - before planting the Stars and Stripes flag at 0341 GMT.

		They also unveiled a plaque bearing President Nixon's signature and an inscription reading: "Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind."

		After filming their experience with a portable television camera the astronauts received a message from the US President.

		President Nixon, in the White House, spoke of the pride of the American people and said: "This certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made."
