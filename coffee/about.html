	<h2>Our Story</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="images/owners.jpg" alt="Caffe shop owners one male one female both wholesome-looking">
			Over the past few years we've amassed enough coffee beans leftover from the grinders in local co-ops to open our own shop! We are very happy to invite the public to enjoy our collection.

				This week, we were very surprised to find that half of our beans were actually roasted nuts! We hope that our customers didn't notice. They certainly left energized enough.
