	<h2>Our Story</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="images/owners.jpg" alt="Caffe shop owners one male one female both wholesome-looking">

				This week, we were very surprised to find that half of our beans were actually roasted nuts! We hope that our customers didn't notice. They certainly left energized enough.
